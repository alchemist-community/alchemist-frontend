Future Rewards Line Chart:
Ownership Ratio = getFutureVaultStakeUnits / getFutureTotalStakeUnits
Ether rewards = Ownership Ratio * Future unlocked rewards
Future Mist = current mist * 1.1 ^ periods elapsed
Future Mist = Ownership Ratio * Future Mist

REWARD MATH
Changing Variables- duration, mist supply
  unlocked rewards 
* stake units (amount * duration)
% total stake units  
* (duration/60 days) 
* 90/100
=  wei rewards
* mist supply
/ unlocked rewards
= mist rewards
